In the past year, I had the pleasure of serving as a student-at-large representative and a member of the AUS finance committee. My role as the grant coordinator rendered the pleasure of being in contact with various council members. With the help of the VP and finance committee members, we provided financial aid to more than 12 recipients. Whether it was covering operational or conference costs, our help lifted a huge financial burden off their shoulders. I would like to continue that tradition and help facilitate more opportunities for students and clubs to enrich their experience beyond the lecture halls.
